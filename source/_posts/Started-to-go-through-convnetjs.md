After reading several books about deep learning, now I can use `keras` / `tensorflow` to train some models, but the mathmatical implementations behind the libraries are still have to follow. 

Two years ago, when I played with `Karpathy`'s [ConvnetJS], I was shocked by the agrighms behind that. I think now it's time to go through his code, I started a small project to annotate `ConvnetJS` source code and re-write it with `TypeScript`.  You can check my progress from [ConvnetJS Source Annotation](https://github.com/blessdyb/convnetjs-source), you can also check the [documentation](https://convnetjs.beendless.com) directly.
