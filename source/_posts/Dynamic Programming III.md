## [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence)

If we define dp[i] as the longest increasing subsequence of [0, i]. Then dp[i] >= 1. And the state transition function is `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` here j âˆˆ [0, i).

```golang
func lengthOfLIS(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    dp := make([]int, n)
    dp[0] = 1
    result = 1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        dp[i] = 1
        for j := 0; j < i; j++ {
            if nums[i] > nums[j] {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
            }
        }
        result = max(result, dp[i])
    }
    return result
}
```

## [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

```golang
func findLengthOfLCIS(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    dp := make([]int, n)
    dp[0] = 1
    result := 1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1] {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        } else {
            dp[i] = 1
        }
        if result < dp[i] {
            result = dp[i]
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

We can reduce the space complexity to O(1)

```golang
func findLengthOfLCIS(nums []int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    count := 1
    result := 1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1] {
            count++
        } else {
            count = 1
        }
        if count > result {
            result = count
        }
    }
    return result
}
```
